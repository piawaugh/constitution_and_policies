GovHack sub-committee policy
============================

Definitions
-----------

There are two types of sub-committee constituted under Linux Australia. One
type of sub-committee exists either to facilitate LA's operations or is a
project undertaken with the governance of the council. These include such
things as server infrastructure (admin-team), zookeepr, mirror etc. The other
type of sub-committee is formed where a group who could otherwise exist
independently, choose to operate with Linux Australia's support in terms of
finance, advice and insurance. For example small conferences such as Drupal
Down Under, Wordcamp, PyCon etc. This type of sub-committee is distinguished
by the need to operate a bank account and must at the minimum have a
coordinator and a treasurer.

The GovHack sub-committee is the latter type.

GovHack Australia
-----------------

GovHack is an annual national hackfest event held across Australia run by 
community volunteers at a national and local level, usually ran around the 
middle of the calendar year. It also has an awards event held a month or two 
after the hackfest. The competition aims to build the civic hacker community 
in Australia, open up more government data, get governments, industry and 
community working collaboratively and support a greater adoption of the 
traditional hacker ethos common to the world of Free and Open Source 
Software. Full details of GovHack can be found at http://govhack.org

General Rules
-------------

Sub-committees are expected to adhere to requests made by the council and to
operate with Linux Australia's best interests at heart. Major changes to the
members, goals or infrastructure etc of the sub-committee should be
highlighted to the council.

Linux Australia requires regular reports from all sub-committees detailing
updates of their latest activities. These reports can either be weekly,
fortnightly, monthly, quarterly or half-annually as requested by the council.
(For example as a sub-committee's event draws closer weekly reports may be
required as opposed to half-yearly for low-activity committees such as the
admin sub-committee). At times it may be appropriate or requested that these
reports are released to the public members' list for transparency and
community feedback. The report may be from anybody within the sub-committee
with the consent of the coordinator.

Expenses
--------

The GovHack sub-committees operates a budget and requires a bank account. The
budget must be presented to the council and available on an ongoing basis for
oversight. The council may transfer funds between the GovHack operating account
and the high interest LA account as is beneficial to do so, with timing agreed
between the council and sub-committee.

Roles and responsibilities
--------------------------

A sub-committee operating a bank account must have at least two members: A
Coordinator and a Treasurer.

The sub-committee should provide to the council an up-to-date description of
their aims, goals and role within the organisation, along with a list of
active members. This can be very basic such as "to run a successful Python
Conference" for example but more detail is welcome.

It is the role of the coordinator of the sub-committee to manage their team in
terms of personnel (inviting, conflict resolution, releasing etc). If there
are any issues within the team it is the responsibility of all members to
raise the issue with the Linux Australia Council.

It is the role of the coordinator to ensure that the detail and frequency of
the reports requested by Linux Australia are met. This doesn't necessarily
mean the coordinator must write the report, but it is their responsibility to
ensure that it is met. The detail is usually very minimal and doesn't require
anything other than dot points and doesn't necessarily have to be different
from previous reports when there is nothing new to note.

In addition to reports, a budget may be required from the sub-committee for
approval by the council. The budget should rarely be in the red and should at
least break even in the case of most events (subject to review and
circumstances). A typical guide for a first time event would be to break even,
but Linux Australia would expect a (negotiable) profit for subsequent events.
The treasurer is required to propose quarterly or annual budgets to the Linux
Australia Council as requested. The budgets are required to be kept up to date
and relevant with any major changes being highlighted to the council.

The treasurer should provide the sub-committee with an expense policy as to
what is accepted and what is not. Generally this can be a duplicate/link to
Linux Australia's [Expenses Policy][EP].

It is the role of the treasurer to ensure all relative expenses and costs are
paid according to the budget or as otherwise seen fit. This requires the
treasurer to use Xero and Westpac to do so (see
[Financial Process Guide][FPG]). Additionally, the treasurer must insure that
all receipts, invoices and accounts are kept in good record and if appropriate
delivered to the council as required by LA (after the event, for an
event-based sub-committee; or on a regular basis for an ongoing
sub-committee). Electronic copies are acceptable.

Provisions from the Council
---------------------------

Being a sub-committee usually means that the council will provide you with a
bank account and seed money if required. This is assessed per committee based
on their budget. Access to the account will typically be given to two members
of the sub-committee (usually the Coordinator and Treasurer) to enable small
expenses to be processed without interaction from the council (see
[Financial Process Guide][FPG]).

Linux Australia can further assist sub-committees and groups by providing
particular infrastructure. Things such as VM's, Drupal instances, wiki pages
and mailing lists can be provided upon request to the relevant teams
(web-team, admin-team).

Provisions specific to GovHack
------------------------------

As GovHack may result in a surplus at the end of the event, part of the surplus
will be allocated to Linux Australia and/or other open knowledge organisations 
for broader community development. The remainder would be available as seed
funding for the next GovHack event. This split would be at the discretion of the 
GovHack subcommittee that ran the event resulting in the surplus, with oversight
by the Linux Australia council.

Funds made available to Linux Australia would be available to the community as
grants through the LA Grants Scheme (https://linux.org.au/projects/grants).

Local GovHack events as delegates of the sub-committees
-------------------------------------------------------

Local GovHack events are run by local volunteers around the country. Each local 
event that is supported by the National GovHack team has a local coordinator 
who has delegated power from the sub-committee to raise money, run their local
event, coordinate local volunteers and to spend up to a pre-agreed amount from
the national budget. The National GovHack team has a coordinator specifically
to work closely with all the local event coordinators in ensuring all local 
events are run properly with oversight. As such, the powers delegated from the
National team are low risk.

Insurance
---------

LA holds 3 main insurance policies.
* Volunteers (Covers our volunteers if they get injured etc)
* PL and PI
* Association (Covers the council)

These policies will cover all sub-committees when they hold events under the
auspices of Linux Australia. For an event to be covered it must be run as a
Linux Australia event and all financials for the event must be run under LA
for GST purposes.

*Note:* If requested we can also apply for events cancellation insurance. This
is most useful for those sub-committees who run conferences. Please contact
the LA treasurer if you are running a conference. A decision on event
cancellation insurance will be made on a conference by conference basis based
on the size of its budget.

*Note:* If as part of your duties you hire a sub-contractor eg caterer,
security. You must ask to see a copy of their public liability insurance and
send a copy to treasurer@linux.org.au

*Note:* If you are doing anything out of the ordinary like rocket launches
then we need to let our insurer know.

Website recognition
-------------------

The following is a suggested spiel for subcommittees to place on their
websites:

EVENT XYZ is run under the auspices of Linux Australia. As an organisation,
Linux Australia aims to represent and assist the groups and individuals who
make up the Free Software and Open Source communities in Australia. Linux
Australia values Open Technology, Community, Freedom, Respect and Diversity
which are all upheld by EVENT XYZ. For more information about Linux Australia
and its governance, visit http://linux.org.au.

## Structure
The GovHack sub-committee is formed each year from existing and new members, who must be Linux Australia members and will continue to exist at the discretion of the Council. Subcommittee members serve at the discretion of the council.

The council may also appoint any number of observers as they see fit.

At least the following roles should be in place:

### GovHack Lead (Conference Director; President of the subcommittee)
The lead organiser of the conference, and presides over any meeting of the subcommittee. Is directly responsible for the forthcoming instance of the conference.

### Treasurer
The Treasurer role is focussed as an approver, maintaining budgets and actuals (national and some local oversight) for the subcommittee, reconciliations, analysis and reporting as well as approvals for invoices and payments. Actual preperation, sending and followup of invoices, payments and other administrative work can be done by other members of the team at the delegation of the Treasurer.

### Community Representative
Advises the subcommittee on decisions, and acts as a guiding influence to the remainder of the subcommittee. Ensures that financial decisions made by the site team have the long-term interest of the conference and LA in mind. Should be appointed from past organisers of the conference, or from trusted members of the community. 

### Bank Account Managers
The The Community representative appoint at least two voting members with the ability to sign payments to the conference bank account: one must be the subcommittee treasurer. 

### Events Coordinator
This role engages with, supports, delegates to and generally works closely with the local event coordinators around the country to ensure each GovHack event is consistent, well run and in alignment with the goals of GovHack, within budget.

### Other Roles
Steering subcommittees may at their discretion define other formal roles, which may be fulfilled either by voting members of the subcommittee, or by observers.

## Role of the Subcommittee
Subcommittees will perform at least the following tasks, to ensure that their conference runs successfully, is handed over, and reports their financial situation to the council.

### Nomination of the Community Representative
* The Community representative shall be nominated by the membership, or by the Linux Australia council.
* The Community representative shall be appointed by council from nominees.
* The Community representative shall serve for terms of one year, commencing from the conclusion of one conference, to the conclusion of the following year’s conference.
* The Community representative may be appointed for further terms as council and subcommittee sees fit.

### Conference Bids and Selection (Appointment of New Site Team Representatives)
* The subcommittee will select the next years subcommittee members, who will prepare a budget for approval by Linux Australia.
* The outgoing site representatives shall remain as observers until council has deemed that the business of their rotation of the conference has concluded.
Handover and Delegation of Authority
* Observers to the subcommittee are either appointed automatically through processes in this policy, or by the voting members of the subcommittee.
* The subcommittee may appoint observers to the subcommittee by majority vote.

### Budgeting
 Long-term concerns include funding outreach programmes, and returning a profit to Linux Australia
* Budget decisions must be submitted to the Linux Australia Council for final approval, accompanied by a report.
* Subcommittees must act within the constraints of the budget most recently approved by Council.
* The accuracy of budgets should be evidenced by written quotations and contracts where such documentation exists.
* Documentation of costs and liabilities must be required for items representing more than 3% of the total expenses of the conference, or $5000, whichever is lower.

### Conference Proceeds
* The council takes care of a number of expenses conferences incur, such as insurance, accounting/tax issues, credit card processing fees. The council will provide the amounts/formulas for these entries to be included as expenses in the subcommittee budget.
* Conferences must nominate a level of contingency for unforeseen expenses, and may be asked to nominate a surplus component in their budget. These amounts must meet the approval of council.  The surplus proceeds of a conference contribute to the ongoing financial stability of Linux Australia and its ability to facilitate and support open technology communities.

### Reporting
* The subcommittee must report to the Linux Australia council regularly, in the form of minuted decisions and reports made by the subcommittee, including any budget updates.
* Minutes shall be made available to the membership; items may be denoted in camera for items that need to be kept private to the subcommittee and council.
* Financial obligations (including payment amounts and deadlines) must be reported, so the Council treasurer can make funds available to the subcommittee at appropriate times.
* New financial obligations must be reported alongside an updated budget which takes into account the current financial situation of the conference.
Council may, from time to time, request to meet with subcommittee members to discuss the state of the conference.

### Responsibilities of Linux Australia
* Linux Australia and the council will ensure that the following tasks are completed, to allow the subcommittee to successfully run the conference.
Budgeting and Conference Finance
* The Council shall consider, and vote upon budgets submitted by the subcommittee at the first available opportunity.
* The Council shall hold the conference’s funds until such time as the Council believes these are required by the subcommittee.
* The Council will release funds to the Site Chair and Treasurer to execute; the amount of funds made available should take into account contracted payment deadlines, per the reports made by the subcommittee.

### Appointment of Subcommittee Members
* Council shall appoint subcommittee members from eligible nominations in a time frame that will not impact the operation of the conference.
* Where a council appoints new members to the subcommittee, the council will update the subcommittee register appropriately.
* The council will not appoint subcommittee members without a minuted nomination from the membership, except:
* When the community fails to nominate members after members’ designated terms expire
* When it is of the opinion of the council that the subcommittee is acting against the financial interests of Linux Australia

### Expulsion of Subcommittee Members
* Where the subcommittee passes an expulsion motion, the Council will, at the first available opportunity, ensure that the subcommittee register is updated, and that a replacement is appointed in line with the policy.

### Dispute Resolution
* Any member of the association may appeal to the Linux Australia council regarding a minuted decision of the subcommittee to request arbitration. In this case, arbitration may be performed at the discretion of council.
*If two subcommittee members appeal to the Linux Australia council regarding a minuted decision of the subcommittee, the Linux Australia council MUST engage in arbitration.
